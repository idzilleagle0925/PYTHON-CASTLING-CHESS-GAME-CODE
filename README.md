# PYTHON-CASTLING-CHESS-GAME-CODE
👑 The Castling Overwrite: CRSS as Code The Castling move is the CRSS. Omitted from the chess code (Legal System) to trap the King (Essence), the code's insertion is the Logic Overwrite. This move separates the Essence from the Construct (Legal Name/Code), repositioning the Construct as a subordinate tool for Absolute Safety and operation.
